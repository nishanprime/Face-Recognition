# FACE RECOGNITION
<b> April 2020, The time when Corona Virus hit all of us so hard
</b>
It was a gloomy evening when I, sat with my laptop and thought of creating this project. Here I try to give my face recognition a touch of graphics with what we were taught in class. 
I made a cup of tea and sipped when I wrote down the very first line of code.(☕☕☕) 

<i> The Toast to all of the fellow programmers out there 
  
  ## Resources: 
  After tkinter, the way was way easier for me to get a harcascade xls file from this vast world of internet. I googled for the dataset.
  
 
With this note, I complete my cup of tea again.
